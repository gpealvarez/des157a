        //my code is able to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 with the exception of those numbers that are divisible by 3, where it prints "Fizz" instead, and those numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), where it prints "Buzz" instead.

        for(let i=1; i<101; i++){
            if (i % 3 == 0 ){
                console.log("FIZZ");
            } else if (i % 5 == 0){
                console.log ("BUZZ");
