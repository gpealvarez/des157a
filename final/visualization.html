        <p> For my final project visualization, I created a usability test to see how effective the changes I meant to make for this project would be. I user-tested three people and asked the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>While clicking through the test did you find anything confusing?</li>
            <li>Is there an interaction/ button that you think is missing?</li>
            <li>Do you think you had enough user feedback?</li>
            <li>What aspects made this game feel like an actual game?</li>
            <li>Is there something else you think I should add to make it better?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WHAT USERS SAID</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The duration of the initial page was too long, which made them wonder if they needed to do anything to access it (like clicking).</li>
            <li>Maybe the pop-up with instructions could also benefit from having an X-button.
            </li>
            <li>The last page could have a “quit” button that leads to the main page and the “start new game” button could lead to the start of a game page.</li>
            <li>The buttons themselves could benefit from a hover effect that lets users know the button is clickable.</li>
            <li>The start and ending pages of the game were classic of game design.</li>
            <li>In terms of what could be added they said animation of sorts, maybe making the coin spin, and sound effects when clicking something.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p> From watching the users test my game, I relaized the yeah maybe the after delay on the initial page is too long, which makes users think they have to interact somehow. I also saw the not knowing if to click a button because there wasn’t anything telling them they cold (like a hover effect). In general I think everything my users said about my test were spot on, and I feel like there is a lot of room for improvement, and I should focus more on perfecting the feedback users get.
        </p>
