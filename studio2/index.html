				<h2>NAMSAN TOWER</h2>
				<p>Being one of the most distinctive areas you can visit in Korea and a national landmark, the Namsan Tower is a place where you can go to view South Korea to its fullest. This tower is located in 105 Namsangongwon-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul and seems to be at the center of Seoul surrounded by hills and nature. There are two ways to get the tower itself, which is by walking up the hill towards the tower or taking the cable car up.</p>

				<p>Once you are at the top of the hill where the tower is located, there are many attractions you can take pictures with, or simply experience such as sightseeing towards the city, and making your mark in this place by leaving a lock attached to the barricades. These locks are usually left by couples who go visit and want to declare their love this way (beware, this place is very much filled with couples), but this experience is not restricted to only this kind of mark. Up there you can also find some shops where you can buy food, water or gifts among other things.</p>

				<h2>BANPO BRIDGE</h2>
                <p>Among the many bridges crossing the Han River in Seoul,the Banpo Bridge is definitely one to experience. There are many attractions surrounding this bridge, but the main attraction is the light show that they have at night every day. Water and light shoot from the bridge with the rhythm of the songs of the night. This show can be enjoyed from the Banpo Park that is located just before the bridge begins, and there is usually a large crowd as well as places for you to sit and enjoy the show. </p>

                <p>The ambience while enjoying the show is very serene, and many people also enjoy coming to this place with their significant others to enjoy the show and watch the lights reflect off the bridge itself. Aside from the show there are also attractions around the park you can visit, and there are also places were you can buy food/snacks to enjoy while watching the show. Many follow the tradition of eating packaged ramen while overlooking the the river.</p>

				<h2>STARFIELD LIBRARY</h2>
				<p>Located inside the Coex Starfield Mall at 513 Yeongdong-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, this library is by far one of the best libraries you will ever see. This library not only has a variety of books and topics to choose from (mostly in Korean), but it also has a lot of areas where you can simply sit and read or pass the time as well. Nevertheless, the main attraction in this library is obviously the layout of the library and how the bookshelves go all the way to the ceiling, leaving anyone who goes inside in awe. There is also a lot of light in this area because the ceiling is basically a dome of glass that allows for the perfect amount of natural light to come in.</p>

				<p>This library is definitely a go-to if you are looking to visit Gangnam, which is the place the song “Gangnam Style” refers to. The library is definitely a great place to take pictures and it is one of the most popular places for tourists to visit, as you will probably see by the amount of people that accumulate at the center of the library. Besides the library, the mall in general is a great place to do shopping as well, and there will be a lot of shopping options available for you (this mall is huge).

				<h2>LOTTE WORLD</h2>
				<p>Located at 240 Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu in Seoul, Lotte World is South Korea’s most well known theme park. You might notice by the pictures that it seems to be surrounded by a giant dome, and that’s because it is! The main theme park is located indoors, and that is where a lot of the action happens. There are many types of rides available for a variety of age groups, and they also have their own characters that are the face of the park.</p>

				<p>There is also a park that is located in the outside, and this section of the park has more extreme rides, a shop, and there is also a castle that will remind you of Disney. There are a lot of traditions that can be seen within this park, and the most relevant one is that you are able to rent school uniforms just while you are at the park, so you can reminisce on being in grade school with your friends and enjoying time like good times! It does not matter if you have already graduated or how old you are, this is simply a common thing locals do. And just like in Disneyland, you can see many individuals wearing accessories in their heads, such as ears, and headbands that represent the characters of the park.</p>
