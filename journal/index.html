        <h2>BEST PRACTICES FOR FORM DESIGN</h2>
        <p id="bottomdeco"> ⟡ᝰ⋆˙</p>

        <p>While learning about the best practices for form design, i realized that ultimately, the main goal was to facilitate conversion when users attempt to use an app of a website. This can be done by designers when they are able to successfuly create a form that is easy to understand, straightforward, and easy for the users to complete. There were multiple key practices that were highlighted in the artcile such as minimizing input fields, having one column layouts, having specific steps that guide a user succesfuly to compleiton, asking easy questions first so they don't give up answering the form right away, labeling input areas, among many other tips. </p>

        <p>The article also highlihts how important it is to have an action button with proper labeling style so that is stands out from the rest of the form, and to provide some sort of feedback after this button is pressed (always displayed in a positive matter even it is an error message). At the end of the day, it seems like in order to create a succesful form, we should be avidly using user-centric design so that instructions are clear, and the users have a smooth time navigating the form. </p>

        <p> I feel like at some point in their lives, everyone has done some sort of quiz online to "learn what Harry Potter house you would be in", or "learn more about your future", and there have been instances where the excitement of finding out (whatever you expect to find out by taking the quiz) dies immediately. Nevertheless, I have always found the form to find out which personality you are out of 16 in the Myers Brigs test to be nicely laid out. I really enjoy how simple the page is to navigate, and how easy it is to just go in and start answering the test. there is great feedback provided for the users after clicking an option that lets you know yhat you are moving on to thenext question, and the action buttons are easy to identify. This form definelty guides the users ins a straighforward and easy manner like the one the article explains, and you can <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">click here</a> if you'd like to check it out for yourself.  </p>
