        <h2>PROJECT SUMMARY</h2>

        <p> For my final project I will be upgrading my Game On! project because I felt like there was a lot of space for improvement. Since it is the last studio project we worked on, I feel like I had the most ideas to implement for this projects to actually look as a game.
        </p>

        <h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

        <p> For my Game of Pig I will be focusing on the design and usability of the game itself. I really want to improve the UI/UX to the best of my capabilities so that users have an easy time navigating the game and there is little to no room for confusion. I will follow overlay best practices to indicate when a user has entered the game, and when they have won. I would also like to make it more dynamic so that the user gets a feedback of sorts whenever they press a button or interact with the page in any way.
        </p>

        <h2>EXPERT FEEDBACK</h2>

        <p>  I have a group of 3-4 people who are interested in UI/UX themselves and also play a lot of videogames, so I will be asking them for their feedback since they will be able to give me a better idea on the UI/UX, best game practices and also catch anything I might've missed in my design.
        </p>
